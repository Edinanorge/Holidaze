![Screenshot](/public/holidaze.png)

This project is my project Exam 2 for Noroff. It's using Vite as bundler and built with React and TypeScript. Our objective was to demonstrate proficiency in modern web development practices, including component-based architecture and strong typing. This project showcases our skills in creating a responsive web application while fulfilling course requirements.
